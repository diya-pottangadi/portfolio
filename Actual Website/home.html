                    <p>Welcome! I'm Diya, a 3rd year Computer Science student with a minor in the Design of the User Experience. <br> <br>
                        I found myself really getting into the tech industry when I started learning about connection in the 11th grade--how tech connects us and how everything we use was developed and engineered. It got me thinking about how truly everything works, from basic webpages to search engines and everything. This curiosity led me to Computer Science and the urge to learn as much as I can, both conceptually but also how to develop it myself. <br> <br>
                        I love to learn, and I like to think about these prime years of discovery as my journey in tech--finding my space, learning, developing my skills, and truly figuring out what I particularly love and want to do. I've also found a love for user experience within my journey so far, because it gives a reason behind developing. Every single thing developed has a reason behind it--for the users and its cool figuring out why. <br> <br>
                        Besides that, I love to read and I love to write (keep scrolling for my blog and to learn more about my journey in tech). I also love nature (touching grass) and exploring New York City (greatest city in the world). <br> <br> 
                        But anyways, <strong>welcome to my tech journey</strong>, so glad to have you here :).
