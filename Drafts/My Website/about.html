          <h2>📖🖊️ My Story</h2>
          <p>
            My journey in tech began in 9th grade when I took Intro to Programming 
            for the first time. I fell in love with it truly by my junior year of 
            high school when I learned about how the internet truly works—from 
            routers to IP addresses to how it connects us and the digital divide. 
            I realized how powerful technology is and how it builds community—and 
            I wanted to be a part of it.

          <h2>🎯 My Values</h2>
          <p>
            
I love to learn. I love gaining new skills and gaining new experiences and insight.
<br> <br>
But beyond that, I value community and unity and how it’s important to embrace our differences and build strong inclusive environments. I work to include this in my daily life by taking on active roles in my community, hoping to create a welcoming space, especially in tech. 
<br> <br>
On a weekly basis, I volunteer at Robert Treat Academy Charter School in Newark, NJ to promote STEM to middle school girls. I serve as the Event Coordinator at WiCS, and try to create a welcoming environment to my residents.
