Basically, I tried making my personal website multiple times but I couldn't figure out what I truly wanted 
or how to get the tiny (unclear) vision I had onto the screen. These folders show me practicing, trying, experimenting, 
and giving up and starting over. Decided to save it because I truly believe that its not about how it ends, but how you get there.
